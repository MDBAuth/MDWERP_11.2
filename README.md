This notebook outputs innundation data which will be used for MD-WERP Strategic Project 11.2.

It access Landsat data from Google Earth Engine and calculates monthly maximum inundation (as well as clear dry areas and "bad" areas). The outputs are raster images.

Also can be used to calculate percentage of inundation images e.g. % innundation per pixel for images between 2000 and 2010. The output is a raster image.
