The **Murray–Darling Water and Environment Research Program (MD-WERP)** is a 4-year, $20 million Australian Government initiative to strengthen scientific knowledge of the Murray–Darling Basin through generating new knowledge, innovation and tools.

**Project 11.2 ‘Predicting changes to the persistence and connectivity of in-channel aquatic habitat in the lower Darling River'** aimed to model the connectivity of persistent in-channel waterbodies and quantify the flow needed to connect them.
The objectives of this project were to first, map the spatial distribution of in-channel aquatic habitat in the lower Darling River (Louth to Menindee) and develop a spatial time-series of surface water persistence to quantify main channel aquatic habitat and connectivity. Then to develop relationships between river flow and the connectivity of main-channel aquatic habitat. Finally, provide scenario evaluations the presence and connectivity of aquatic habitat under different flow regimes (e.g., under climate change and water use)
